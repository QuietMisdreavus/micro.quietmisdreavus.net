description: a roundup of video games i liked this year
categories: self

I feel like iâ€™ve played quite a few more video games this year than in previous years, and i can
probably thank the Steam Deck for that. I donâ€™t have a Windows PC and i donâ€™t really like playing
games at a desk, so i was missing out on a lot of games that release primarily or exclusively on PC.
Now, though, i have access to a wealth of indie games and niche releases, and a platform that can be
bent to play most games under the sun.

So it all added up to spending a lot more time actually playing games than before. Iâ€™ve put my hands
on a lot of games this year, and i felt like listing them all up in no particular order. Not all of
these have had the same amount of play time or gained the same amount of love, but i feel like
theyâ€™re all worth a look.

## Goodboy Galaxy (GBA)

*EDIT*: Many thanks to [RetroAchievements][]' "year in review" email that went out January 1 to
remind me that i also played this lovely game this year!

[RetroAchievements]: https://retroachievements.org/

I'm utterly entranced by the idea of making homebrew games for retro platforms. It just feels really
cool to take the modern understanding of game design and hardware execution and port it back to an
older system to create something that can truly shine. Goodboy Galaxy definitely ticks all these
boxes and became something that felt both retro and modern at the same time. It's just a shame that
there wasn't a reference guide i could use to try and mop up all the collectibles and get 100%
completion. I definitely tried, but some of the puzzle-y aspects of the game really stumped me at
the end.

## Myst and Riven

This year i bought the remasters of Myst and Riven. Iâ€™ve played through Myst a bunch of times, so
running through that again was a lot of fun. On the other hand, it was the first time i played
through Riven and actually stuck with it. I bought the strategy guide PDF alongside the game and
referenced it *heavily* while playing. It was really fascinating to jump into the world of Myst and
explore a much more story-focused game. I kinda hope they wind up doing a remake of the later games
in the series.

## Balatro

About a month after its launch, i got bit by Balatro pretty hard. I heard of it through a
gaming-news YouTube channel i follow, who said it was one of the most played games on Steam Deck at
the time. I have since gotten most of the achievements in the game, and if it were easier to pick up
(and/or if it had cross-save functionality between Steam and iOS) i would probably go back and grind
the really tedious ones.

## Luck Be a Landlord and Bingle Bingle

After Balatro i wanted to see other games in the vein of "letâ€™s take a casino game and turn it into
a roguelike". As far as i understand, Luck Be a Landlord is kind of an archetypal game that has
created a few copycats in its success, and itâ€™s easy to see why: Thereâ€™s a simple but compelling
flow of slowly building up your slate of slot-machine icons to create cascading combos. This was a
fun one to just play without spending too much attention on it.

Bingle Bingle, by contrast, is an Early Access "roulette roguelike", and it honestly was a lot of
fun to play. Itâ€™s gotten a few updates over time that have given it some more content, which has
been fun to see. Unfortunately, itâ€™s kind of awkward to play on the Steam Deck (itâ€™s a very
mouse-heavy game), and the last time i tried to run it in CrossOver on my MacBook it crashed on
launch. I would love to revisit this at some point, though!

## Celeste

oh my gosh the trans woman is playing the trans woman game, how original ðŸ™„

I actually didnâ€™t realize i had a copy of Celeste until i was messing around with the [Itch Bundle
Browser][ibb] and spotted it in a charity bundle i bought back in 2020. I wound up loading it up to
give it a try.

A few dozen hours later i wound up beating the game, plus the postgame "Farewell" chapter. I have
not reached 100% - 3C can eat my ass - but i was able to click with the gameâ€™s mechanics really
well. I feel like the story is maybe a bit overbearing, but i like how it handles its subject matter
and the way it portrays its themes. The game flow of having smaller rooms to retry and learn was a
lot nicer than other iterations of "hard" games that tend to include a lot of backtracking for
failure.

## Boneraiser Minions

I *loved* Vampire Survivors last year. The game showed up at the right time as i was recovering from
bottom surgery, and i had a really fun time unlocking everything. So naturally, i developed a strong
interest in the "survivors-like" games that have cropped up in its wake.

Boneraiser Minions is one of these games, with a chunkier pixel-art look and a bit more crude humor
in its flavor text. Thereâ€™s a lot of content to chew through in here, though it does start to feel
repetitive after a while. Still, the soundtrack and the variety in class design made it really fun
to work through most of the achievements.

## Dungeons and Degenerate Gamblers

I thought this would hook me more, but after a frustrating start (which i believe has been smoothed
out in later patches) it kinda slid off. :/ I loved the idea and i love how itâ€™s executed. Maybe i
can pick it back up later on after its had a chance to reset in my brain.

## Vampire Survivors: Ode to Castlevania

I make it a habit to get all the Vampire Survivors DLCs: theyâ€™re cheap and give me another excuse to
come back to one of my favorite games from last year. Their last few have been crossover efforts,
and this one is an *enormous* love letter to the series that inspired VSâ€™s aesthetics.

## UFO 50

UFO 50 fascinates me, as an indie game enthusiast and a retro game enthusiast. I feel like i could
write an entire post about its conceit (and i probably should), but the idea of creating a fictional
retro game company writing fictional retro games for a fictional retro console is *fascinating* to
me. UFO 50 contains multitudes, and there are several total bangers in there, and many more games
that will absolutely find their niche.

Itâ€™s just kind of a shame that the ordering of the collection puts the "oldest" games first, which
are kind of the weakest. If youâ€™re not completely sold, watch some videos about the later games in
the collection, or try them out starting at number 20 or so.

## Parking Garage Rally Circuit

Oh my god this game is silly fun. I havenâ€™t played this one as extensively as some of the others on here, but my time with it has been a blast. Itâ€™s rare for a game to have me grinning and laughing as much as this game has done. The conceit of having a race through a converted parking structure, and letting you go Way Too Fast through the track, barely holding onto control of your racer, makes the destruction on failure feel silly instead of frustrating.

## Astroâ€™s Playroom and Astro Bot

I took advantage of Black Friday sales this year to upgrade my home console to a PS5. While waiting
for the discs i ordered to arrive, i played the pack-in game, Astroâ€™s Playroom. The best way to
describe this game is "a tech demo masquerading as a collectathon 3D platformer, plus a celebration
of PlayStation history". There are many tricks that use all the features of the DualSense
controller, and many nods to the PlayStation brand and the games that sold them. Itâ€™s a short but
fun romp and a good introduction to the console.

Astro Bot is that idea taken into a full-length game. You are roaming through different worlds,
finding your lost bot friends. The trick is that many of them are dressed like characters from
historic PlayStation games. Itâ€™s fun to recognize references and go "oh hey itâ€™s that guy!" I feel
like the game would fall flat for anyone who has *not* followed this series of consoles as closely
as i have, but for me it was a load of fun, even as someone who historically dislikes 3D
platformers.

## Final Fantasy XV

Since i had gotten the PS5, i took a look back through the stack of PS4 games i had that i hadnâ€™t
really played and decided that i finally wanted to give FF15 a try. For being a big Final Fantasy
nerd, i kinda stopped following the numbered series after FF13. I had a brief tryst with FF14 in
2018, but i fell off that because the higher-level gameplay was starting to feel too intimidating to
keep up with. When FF15 came out, i bought a copy relatively early on, but my taste for long-running
games with a lot of ramp-up time had kinda soured with young-adult autistic burnout.

All that is to say, this was a game that i felt sad about not trying. While waiting for PS5 game
discs to ship (i managed to pick up the console in-store, but the games i ordered had to be
shipped), i threw in the disc for FF15 and started working through it. It feels weirdly slow-paced
compared to the smaller titles iâ€™ve grown used to, and the weird product placement kinda threw me
off. But, it does feel like thereâ€™s a gem in here if i can be patient about it. Iâ€™m in Chapter 3
right now, but this game is somewhat backburnered because the next entry is currently in the disc
drive instead.

## Sonic Frontiers

I picked this up as a random grab on sale, but iâ€™m having fun with it so far! Iâ€™ve never really
gotten into the Sonic series so it was cool to be able to grab it and run around. I have a hard time
playing "classic Sonic"-style games because it feels like itâ€™s playing a tension between "going fast
through the map" and "exploring the map to find the optimal route". Iâ€™ve never played a "modern
Sonic"-style game, so i dunno how those are supposed to feel, but the "cyber space" segments of
Frontiers feel pretty fun to work through.

I know that the "open world" aspect of the game was a new thing for the franchise, but i actually
like how it lets me explore at my own pace while still giving some little platforming challenges
here and there. Iâ€™m not super far into the game right now, but so far iâ€™m enjoying it.
