This post more or less picks up where [my last post][unreality] left off, with some of the thoughts
over the last year or so.

[unreality]: https://micro.quietmisdreavus.net/self/2020/11/21/steeped-in-unreality/

To start, i'll set the scene with a relevant quote from that post:

> I don't think i've ever had a really solid “sense of self”. There have been incidental things that
> i've attributed to my personality, like “a warm demeanor” or “a go-with-the-flow mentality”, but
> nothing that i've synthesized into a “whole person” that i can point to when i want to point to
> “me”.

> [footnote attached to the preceding paragraph:]
>
> An important thing to note is that this didn't change or go away when i started taking HRT or
> transitioning! Trans people experience depersonalization more often than cis people, but usually,
> medically or socially transitioning is an effective treatment for trans-related depersonalization.
> Unfortunately, that hasn't been the case for me. That lack of clarity on my self-image after
> taking hormones or “living full-time” has created a sort of “gender impostor syndrome”, so to
> speak, where i compare the common narrative of “strongly feeling trans” or “lifting the veil
> shortly after taking hormones” against my experience, and feel like i'm “doing it wrong” somehow.

While it certainly hasn't been the only thing going on in therapy (sometimes things just happen in
my life and that conversation takes up the time slot), there's definitely been a lot of time spent
thinking and talking about personal identity in the year+ since the events of the last post.

A therapy approach my therapist picked up early on that we returned to periodically is the concept
of the [Internal Family Systems][ifs] (IFS) model of the self. The idea here is that people can
generally pick apart their mind into a set of "parts" that each contribute some certain cluster of
reactions, thought patterns, or the like. The IFS model also posits a "core Self" layered underneath
the "parts", but i still had trouble connecting with that idea as such. Still, it was a useful model
to build up over time.

[ifs]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Family_Systems_Model

Two major players in the parts-model that came out were "the logician" and "the storyteller". "The
Logician" was drawn to breaking things down logically, seeing the chain of cause-and-effect, and
generally understanding how things work in a mechanical way. In other words, it's the part that's so
freaking interested in code. "The Storyteller", on the other hand, is much less interested in the
mundane. Instead, it loves to find fanciful metaphors to dress everything in, or ways to connect
things into a fantastic story. It sometimes shows up as a desire to speak in a overly formalized
tone, or turning existing concepts into gateways for magical thinking. A good example of this is
[this old Twitter thread][concepts-thread] where i described common traits in Rust using silly or
abstract metaphors.

During one session, we were talking about how "the storyteller" seemed to have created a situation
where i could imagine a hypothetical future but not be able to take the initiative to put it into
action. All the situations it seemed to dream up were dressed in a veil of impossibility - if most
of my daydreams at some point are magical thinking wanting to get out of my mundane life, i start to
think of even the reasonable daydreams as impossible, as well.

At some point, my therapist went out on a limb and asked, "are you willing to bring the storyteller
forward, and show them the world in front of you?" The idea here was to talk to the "part" that was
creating these daydreams, and connect them with "reality" in the hope that i could stop seeing every
daydream as impossible.

I paused for a moment. "I think so." It took me a second to shift from the model of "these parts are
representations of the way i think" to "these parts can be addressed individually", but after some
time, i was able to connect with "the storyteller" in a way that let me continue with the exercise.

What happened next was jarring. I started to fill with dread - *"this was supposed to be a story! it
wasn't supposed to be real!"* I had thought i was investigating the rationale behind a thought
process, but the resulting emotion was so visceral that it caught me off-guard.

The moment passed quickly, but the experience shook me. I had enough time left in that session to
debrief somewhat, and the ensuing conversation kicked off a lot of introspection and research.

-----

For the next several weeks, i spent a lot of time inside my own head, and reading some information
my therapist had given me. I started to lurk in a new community, to pick up some new jargon and see
some new experiences.

Over time, i started to look at myself in a new light. It was somewhat refreshing to have a new
model that i could use as a jumping-off point into a totally different way to view the way i
interact with the world. There was perhaps a bit of nostalgia to it, too; a few people in the new
community i started lurking in had set up personal sites on places like Neocities or Dreamwidth,
echoing earlier days in the internet where people would set up on those sites' predecessors,
Geocities and LiveJournal.

Another aspect that kicked up some nostalgia was the way that it allowed me to "tell a different
story" about myself (if you'll pardon the pun). This means more than just what i said earlier,
though; as a kid i had a habit of creating a kind of character to role-play on the internet, as part
of that "magical escapism fantasy". As i found myself sliding back into that mode again, i started
to worry i was going in too deep - if this was supposed to be my "model of self", what does it mean
if it includes that fantasy?

I also had a lot of self-doubt about whether even the less-magical version of the model fit me at
all. Much like when i was first trying to figure out the "trans experience", it was easy to find the
exaggerated or sensationalized version of things. Then, as now, i was put off by not being able to
relate to the extremes.

Over time, though, i settled into a version that fits. Even if the concept and terminology i land on
don't 100% describe my personal experience, it's still fine if they provide a decent-enough model
that i can use to describe what's going on. And if i "go off the deep end" and find something
fantastic or magical that also works, that's also fine! The ultimate idea doesn't have to make sense
to *everyone*, as long as it makes sense to *me*. I'm already so far off the beaten track of
"well-understood experience" with being trans, being autistic, and experiencing derealization, that
going any further just means that "some people won't understand me", which is already true! I just
need the vocabulary to understand what's happening, in my own words.

With the aftermath in mind, i want to return to the earlier anecdote; there's an important part i
left out that happened right at the end. The "ensuing conversation" involved me saying something
along the lines of "fronting with the storyteller was a new experience". My therapist picked up on
the specific use of "fronting"; it's a term of art in a particular community, and they knew it. They
encouraged me to see if there was a deeper connection going on, which led to the aforementioned
soul-searching, and ultimately this post.

...so it turns out i'm plural.

More accurately, "i" am the "host" member of a plural system, simultaneously ignoring yet taking
input from my fellow system members for... i don't even know how long?

So let's revisit the previous section, and approach it from this angle. Shortly after that therapy
session where i "brought the storyteller forward", i tried to connect with that "part" as if it were
a fully-fledged "headmate". Whoever it was, they had obviously had a big influence on my life, and i
wanted to approach them on their own terms. It took some effort to understand how to communicate
with someone who lives in your own head, but over time "the storyteller" came forward with a proper
name and pronouns.

I went back and forth not being sure if i was making everything up or not. The popularized pathology
of plural systems involves some amount of consciousness switching, where you "lose some time" as a
different member takes over, right? How could i fit that if i don't feel like i've lost any time
like that?

In the end, i learned about "median" systems, and the idea of "co-consciousness", where system
members aren't 100% separate from each other, or share memories and sensory experiences,
respectively. It was extremely helpful to understand that there was a gradient of plurality, and
that many systems reject the "popular understanding" as reductive. (Kind of like the "popular
understanding" of trans people, heh.)

Most importantly, it turned out that i stopped struggling with the question of "who am i" once this
came to light. This was both because i had much more interesting things to think about, and also
because i could meaningfully break up parts of my experience into a model that made way more sense
than the "core Self" of IFS.

Let me rewind for a second. The world of plurality has so many specialized terms that every
introductory post comes with its own glossary. In lieu of writing yet another "systems 101" style
introduction, i'll instead link to a handful of resources before going on. You don't need to go
through them all end-to-end to continue, but if you're curious, there's a lot of information you can
read.

* [More Than One][] is a somewhat minimalist site, but i think that makes it for a really good
  first-read. It has some really good basic overviews that can provide some base-level
  understanding.
* The [Plurality Playbook][] is a resource created by and for systems that worked at Google, and
  the "singlets" (non-plural people[^people]) who worked closely with them. I personally liked the
  way it brought the experience into practical terms for "being plural in the working world".
* [The Plural Dictionary][] is *incredibly* extensive, and i wouldn't recommend reading it
  cover-to-cover unless you were really interested or curious about different facets of plural life.
  However, if you come across a term you don't recognize (and the system that uses it doesn't have a
  glossary of their own because they use system-specific terminology), you may be able to find a
  pointer here.

[More Than One]: https://morethanone.info/
[Plurality Playbook]: https://www.pluralpride.com/playbook
[The Plural Dictionary]: https://system-dictionary.carrd.co

[^people]: Note that the use of "people" here is somewhat problematic, since members of a plural
    system are generally just as much "people" as the singlets that surround them. I hope it makes
    for a decent enough shorthand without turning this post into a glossary, itself.

The story is far from over. As the title of this post implies, there is still a lot to learn. But
i'm very happy that i can work together to create a shared understanding about the inside of our
head.

So what does this mean for people who need to interact with us now? I'll call out some important
points in a sort of question-and-answer style:

> so do i have to start calling you something different based on who's in control at a given time?

Not really; in fact if you're unsure, i'd ask that you [keep calling us victoria][name]. We have
individual names and a system title, but i'm uncomfortable asking *everyone* to follow that
convention, to be honest. Also, "i" am usually "in front" most of the time anyway, so the question
is moot in this specific situation. (Individual systems may vary; don't take this as general advice
for plural systems in general!)

[name]: https://quietmisdreavus.net/self/2020/05/02/you-can-call-me-victoria/

> can i ask you a billion questions about systems stuff?

Oh god please no. For one, it's like trans stuff - a lot of it is pretty sensitive, and for us
personally i probably won't have an easy answer - like i said, we're still figuring everything out.
But also, there is a truckload of information about plural stuff online; the links above are a good
starting point.

> why are you still using "i" all the time here?

Habit, and also to keep the voice of the "quiet misdreavus"-branded blogs consistent. Even in
purely-systems-focused areas, though, i tend to use "i" a lot because of the specific situation of
one member being in front most of the time, and generally being unsure if other members are around
for a given experience at any given time. I switch around for whenever it feels right. /shrug

> are you going to post about plural stuff on twitter a lot now?

Not on my main @QuietMisdreavus account. It has a voice of its own at this point, and i don't feel
like compromising that. I've registered accounts on [Twitter][] and [Mastodon][] to talk about
systems stuff; if you follow those links you can see another site we set up to talk about our
experience from the in-community/jargon-filled perspective. I've been using the Mastodon account as
a center for experimentation, but i registered the Twitter account recently in preparation to follow
more systems that use Twitter more. Pick whichever suits you.

I've wanted to get this off my chest for a while now. If you made it this far and haven't either
unfollowed/blocked me or posted something rude in reply, i want to thank you, from the bottom of my
heart. The plural experience is so stigmatized that it's really hard to find acceptance in the
world. I'm hopeful that i can continue to find a positive experience in my little corner of the
internet, even if the way i interact with it changes a bit.
