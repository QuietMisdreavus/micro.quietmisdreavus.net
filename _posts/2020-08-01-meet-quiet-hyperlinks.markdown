I guess 2020 is the year of me making new websites. First there was micro (this blog), then there
was [FOSS Pride], now there's ["quiet hyperlinks"]. In the case of micro and links, they both follow
a theme of "i want to post in a place that's not Twitter/Mastodon/Discord". Here the idea was that i
wanted to write medium-form ideas in situations where i would otherwise use a Twitter thread (or
even as a clone of an existing thread).

[FOSS Pride]: https://fosspride.org
["quiet hyperlinks"]: https://links.quietmisdreavus.net

For "quiet hyperlinks", i wanted to replace/supplement the habit of linking to a thing i found and
posting it in a Discord server, or on Twitter. It was also a chance to experiment with some CSS
things i haven't used before (like the `columns` property) and make something that acted a bit
different from my other blogs. I almost tried to wedge the change into this blog, but decided
against it when i got the idea for the front-page. Also, it gives me the chance to write even less
as a "post" because the main idea is "here is this thing i saw" rather than "this is something on my
mind".

Anyway, the new site is at <https://links.quietmisdreavus.net>, with its own RSS feeds if that's how
you roll.

*...oh god why have i made myself three different blogs...*
