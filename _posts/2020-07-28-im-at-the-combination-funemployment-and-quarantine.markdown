(apologies for making this one a Lowercase Aesthetic post. i kinda just wanted to write things and
didn't care about proper capitalization.)

so i'm in a somewhat okay spot right now. the past year or so has been [a bit of a whirlwind][home].
since moving to Denver back in December, i feel like i've continued to reinvent myself in new ways.
i started therapy. i started antidepressants and ADHD medications. i gradually regained the ability
to [work on personal coding projects][egg-mode].

[egg-mode]: https://github.com/search?o=asc&q=repo%3Aegg-mode-rs%2Fegg-mode+author%3AQuietMisdreavus+author-date%3A%3E2020-05-01&s=committer-date&type=Commits

it doesn't feel 100% sunshiny yet, though. the therapy has been slow going, though i do feel like
it's starting to close in on interesting things. (also it's responsible for the ADHD diagnosis, so i
can't totally discount it.) the meds i've started haven't been home runs; i recently switched
antidepressants and i think it's backfired some, and the ADHD med hasn't had a huge effect. while
working on egg-mode has given me something quote-and-quote "productive" to spend my days on, it's
not like it's as practical as "looking for a job"[^jobs] or "writing something more flashy as a demo
project". also it's become the yardstick i measure my executive function by, and sometimes that
comes at the exclusion of other things, and it makes the days where i don't do code feel worse.

[^jobs]:
    i have starting looking for work, though. just a couple small feelers via the Recurse Center,
    for now. i'll post something if i want to look more broadly.

the last couple weeks have seemed pretty low-energy, to be frank. while the last few months have
felt like a bit of a gradual climb out of burnout into a headspace where i feel like i can start to
come back to some of my old haunts, i've recently felt like i've been in a bit of a
backslide.[^cymbalta] i know i'm in a decent enough position where i can keep coasting a little bit
longer, though. i know i have a lot of blessings to count, even from where i feel like i'm sitting.

[^cymbalta]:
    honestly, writing this whole post up has really just told me that the antidepressant i switched
    to recently might be an issue. the other one i was on felt *okay*, but also only like it had a
    marginal effect. i could probably try going back to that on a higher dose, tbh. i just get
    nervous about any antidepressant because [the med i've been on forever to prevent
    migraines][amitriptyline] is also in a similar category, so there's a decent chance that taking
    enough of both of them could cause an unpleasant interaction.

anyway, that's where i'm at. here's some of what i've been doing to keep my head above water:

- i've fallen back in with idle games. my current squeeze is [NGU Idle], though it seems to be
  sucking my attention a lot with its active play. it also sucks a whole core on my (admittedly
  under-powered) desktop, so i try not to have it active all the time.
- i keep buying some music occasionally. i've recently been in a metal kick; the band Haken released
  [a new album][virus] recently which i've enjoyed. before that i got into the japanese bands [Cross
  Vein] and [Mary's Blood]. i really enjoy having something energetic and emotional to listen to
  sometimes.
- sometimes when i try to poke at egg-mode i instead get distracted with [customizing my vim
  configuration more and more][vimfiles]. there's something about making a thoroughly personal
  computing environment that really attracts me. i've gotten really into making small personal
  scripts or other kinds of custom tweaks to my various configurations recently, which was
  previously something i avoided but i feel like i've reached a point where i can recognize my
  customizations if i need to use a different computer without my config on it. i still like to keep
  my things "light" for that reason.
- my partner and i have been taking short walks through our neighborhood. it's been nice seeing
  things that you don't really notice while driving. Denver gets kinda warm in the summer, but
  honestly my impression of the weather up here is "like my hometown but with less tornadoes and
  more snow". it feels like home, in a way.
- my partner and i have also gotten into cooking at home. we have an account on [PlateJoy], which
  has been pretty helpful for picking out recipes to try. i feel like i'm eating way better than i
  was a year ago, lol.

where was i going with this? i guess i wanted to post a data point under the heading "getting better
takes time". and also "i get sad/depressed sometimes, like right now". like i said, i'm thankful for
where i'm at, but sometimes i also need to consciously remind myself of that.
