# micro.quietmisdreavus.net

this is effectively a clone of [quietmisdreavus.net], with a different color scheme and the intent
to push smaller posts. i wanted to make a different site for it so that it would have a different
RSS feed, and also so that i could experiment with different ways of posting than on the main blog.
at this phase it's just an experiment, but i hope it goes places.
