# micro.quietmisdreavus.net

this is effectively a clone of [quietmisdreavus.net], with a different color scheme and the intent
to push smaller posts. i wanted to make a different site for it so that it would have a different
RSS feed, and also so that i could experiment with different ways of posting than on the main blog.
at this phase it's just an experiment, but i hope it goes places.

[quietmisdreavus.net]: https://github.com/QuietMisdreavus/quietmisdreavus.net

this repo is automatically rendered and uploaded to NearlyFreeSpeech.Net whenever a new post (or
layout change) is pushed. i wanted to host somewhere other than GitHub Pages for personal reasons,
but having the automatic deployments means that i can (for example) push posts from my phone and
still have the site be updated.
